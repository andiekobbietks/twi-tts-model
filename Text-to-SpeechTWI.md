# Twi Text-to-Speech (TTS) Model using AfroLM

## Overview
This project aims to create a Twi text-to-speech (TTS) model by leveraging AfroLM, a multilingual pre-trained language model for African languages, and fine-tuning it with a pre-trained TTS model.

## Steps to Create Twi TTS Model

### 1. Text Pre-processing
- Prioritize existing text data.
- Split long texts into sentences.
- Normalize tonal variations (e.g., mapping "ǎ" to "á").
- Convert numeric tokens to spoken form (e.g., "12:30" to "twelve thirty").
- Restore missing diacritics using a T5 model fine-tuned on Twi.
- Use Ghana NLP tools like ABENA or BAKO for pre-processing or generating embeddings.

### 2. Model Selection
- Select a pre-trained TTS model from platforms like Hugging Face.
- Consider models trained on multiple languages or related languages (e.g., FastSpeech, VITS).

### 3. Fine-Tuning with AfroLM
- Use AfroLM to generate contextualized embeddings for Twi text.
- Fine-tune the selected TTS model using prepared Twi data and AfroLM embeddings.
- Adapt training and evaluation scripts for the TTS task.

### 4. Deployment
- Create a functional tool in a development environment.
- Deploy in production later.
- Consider using an API to integrate the model into other applications.

## Key Advantages of Using AfroLM
- Strong Twi understanding.
- Data efficiency.
- Contextual embeddings.
- Open source.

## Practical Implementation Steps
1. **Download AfroLM**: Get the model from the Hugging Face repository.
2. **Install dependencies** for AfroLM and chosen TTS models.
3. **Prepare Twi text data** as described above.
4. **Adapt chosen TTS model** to incorporate AfroLM’s Twi embeddings.
5. **Fine-tune the TTS model** with prepared Twi data.
6. **Deploy** the trained model as a functional tool.

By leveraging AfroLM and fine-tuning an existing TTS model with prepared data, you can create a functional Twi text-to-speech model.
