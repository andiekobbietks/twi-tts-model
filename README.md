# Twi Text-to-Speech (TTS) Model using AfroLM

## Overview
This project aims to create a Twi text-to-speech (TTS) model by leveraging AfroLM, a multilingual pre-trained language model for African languages, and fine-tuning it with a pre-trained TTS model.

## Directory Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data.
- `models/`: Contains pre-trained and fine-tuned models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model selection, and fine-tuning.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for preprocessing text, selecting models, and fine-tuning.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, model selection, and fine-tuning.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Steps to Create Twi TTS Model
1. Text Pre-processing
2. Model Selection
3. Fine-Tuning with AfroLM
4. Deployment

## Key Advantages of Using AfroLM
- Strong Twi understanding.

## Recommendations
1. Set CSV file encoding to UTF-8
2. Update database connection strings to use UTF-8
3. Implement proper character encoding in shipping label generation
4. Add encoding validation for data input forms
